            <title>Apple Previews iOS 9</title>
            <link>http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2015/06/08Apple-Previews-iOS-9.html?sr=hotnews.rss</link>
            <description>Apple today unveiled iOS 9, giving a preview of new iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch software that will be available this fall. In this upcoming release, iOS devices become more intelligent and proactive with powerful search and improved Siri features — all without compromising users’ privacy. New multitasking features designed specifically for iPad allow you to work with two apps simultaneously, side-by-side, or with the new Picture-in-Picture feature, to keep watching a video while browsing the web, composing email, or using any other app. “iOS 9 is packed with more intelligence throughout, and delivers big updates to the apps customers use most — Maps supports public transit, a redesigned Notes app provides great new ways to capture ideas, and a beautiful News app delivers content that’s personalized to your interests,” said Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of Software Engineering. “With our new iPad features, users can take advantage of the power of iPad, working in two apps at the same time with Split View, Slide Over, or Picture-in-Picture.”</description>
